  abstract =	 "Within product lines, collections of several related
                  products are defined through their commonalities in
                  terms of features rather than specifying them
                  individually one-by-one. In this paper we present a
                  compositional framework for modeling dynamic product
                  lines by a state-based formalism with both
                  probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors. Rules
                  for feature changes in products made during runtime
                  are formalized by a coordination component imposing
                  constraints on possible feature activations and
                  deactivations. Our framework supports large-scaled
                  product lines described through multi-features,
                  i.e., where products may involve multiple instances
                  of a feature.",
