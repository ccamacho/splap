\section{Empirical study}
\label{sec:stat:impl}

In the field of \SPLs\ analysis, the use of probabilistic methods carries two practical applications. The first one consists in calculating the probability of having a feature in a specific product. This allows us to efficiently assign resources by prioritizing those features with a high probability of being included into the \SPL. The second application consists in estimating the testing coverage in the product line, which allows us to calculate those products that can be generated in the testing process.

This section presents the results obtained from an experimental study to show the applicability and scalability of our
approach. In order to carry out this study, we have developed a tool to implement the proposed probabilistic extension. The source code
of this tool is available at the main project site
\footnote{\url{http://ccamacho.github.io/phd/resources/03_splap.tar}}. The experiments have been executed in a computer with the following features: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Quad-Core CPU E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz, 64 GB of RAM memory and Centos 7 Operating System.

%The simulations were executed based on the implementation of the denotational
%semantics for the probabilistic extension. 

Firstly, we have carried out an experiment to show the computing time required to calculate the probability of having
each feature in a product. In order to run this experiment, a variability model consisting of
1500 features has been used. This variability model
was randomly generated using BeTTy~\cite{SeguraHBC11}. The parameters for
generating the BeTTy model are the following:

\begin{itemize}
        \item The probability of having a mandatory feature is 0.2.
        \item The probability of having an optional feature is 0.3.
        \item The probability of having a feature in a \emph{choose-1} relation is 0.25.
        \item The probability of having a feature in a \emph{parallel} relation is 0.25.
\end{itemize}

        \caption{Computing time analysis for a model consisting of 1500 features.}\label{fig:plot:probs:times}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:times} shows the obtained results from this experiment, where the x-axis depicts the ID of each generated feature and the y-axis represents the time required to calculate the probability of having a feature in a product.
%In this case, the total time to obtain the probability for all the features is linear with respect to the total length of the analyzed term
%\mncomment{Que quiere decir esto? Suena raro porque yo esperaria complejidad $O(2^n)$ siendo $n$ el numero de probabilidades que salen en el termino. Pero vamos, que yo no  se mucho de complejidad!}\ccomen{Es cierto, no lo demostramos ni lo analizamos}.
%\acomen{Yo simplemente quitaría esa frase, lo de que la complejidad es lineal}
It is important to remark that there is a small variation in the processing time for calculating the probability of each single feature. We think that this variation is mainly caused by the inherent noise of the node where the experiment is launched (e.g. disk latencies, operating
system overhead, memory paging, etc.) and, therefore, it is not related to the algorithm itself.

Since the processing time for each feature is relatively low, being around milliseconds, a single delay in
the process scheduling may have a direct impact in the overall algorithm performance. Hence, this overhead
can be considered insignificant since, in general, the time for processing each feature in the model ranges
from 15 to 28 milliseconds.

The model used in the experiments has been executed several times, providing similar results. That is, the
major part of the features require between 15 and 20 milliseconds to be processed, while there is a small
portion of them requiring a processing time between 20 and 38 milliseconds.

	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:probs} shows the probability of each feature in the analyzed model, where the $x$-axis
represents the feature ID and the $y$-axis represents the probability. For the sake of clarity, we provide a chart by sorting the features using its probability as sorting criteria (see Figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:probs:sorted}).
This chart clearly shows that there exist different groups of features having a similar probability.
%
In this case, there are 450 features with, at least, a probability equal to 0.75 of being in a final product. As a conclusion,
this analysis might allow us to establish that by testing only the 28\% of the software product line components, we can ensure that
%the features
%included in,
at least, the 75\% of the generated products, are tested.

Secondly, an experiment to analyze the scalability of our approach have been carried out. We are interested in investigating both the execution time and the amount of memory required for processing a model, when the number of features increases. Hence, we use different configurations for creating a wide spectrum of variability models, which are randomly generated, using a different number of features that ranges from 1,000 to 10,000. Specifically for each case, that is, given a configuration and a number of features, a model is randomly generated 30 times. Additionally, for each model, 100 features are 
randomly selected and, for each one, both the processing time and memory required to calculate its probability are analyzed.

Table~\ref{scalaExperiment} shows the used configurations to generate the variability models for this experiment, 
where \textit{Conf. ID} represents the configuration ID, 
 \textit{Mandatory} represents the probability of having a mandatory feature, 
 \textit{Optional} represents the probability of having an optional feature,
 \textit{Choose-1} represents the probability of having a feature in a \textit{choose-1} relation and
 \textit{Parallel} represents the probability of having a feature in a \textit{parallel} relation.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:boxplot_0_1} and figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:boxplot_0_1_mem} show the execution time and the required amount of memory, respectively, for processing the variability models generated using \textit{Config\_1}. In these models, only 1\% of the features have a parallel relation. In general, the processing time when the number of features increases is linear. Only in few cases, where the number of features ranges from 5000 to 8000, the results provide anomalous values. This is mainly caused by the random nature of the generated models. On the contrary, the memory usage depicts that there are several groups where the memory usage remains constant, one group of models containing between 3,000 and 5,000 features and other group of models containing between 7,000 and 10,000 features. In summary, our implementation shows good scalability results for processing the models generated using \textit{Config\_1}: it requires, in the worst case scenario, 215 ms and 0.32 GB of RAM to process the model.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:boxplot_0_2} and figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:boxplot_0_2_mem} show the results for analyzing the models generated using \textit{Config\_2}. It is important to remark that 20\% of the features in the generated models have a parallel relation. In this case, both the execution time and memory usage for processing a model when the number of features increases are exponential. These charts clearly show a turning point when the model reaches 6,000 features and, therefore, the required processing time and  memory are significantly lower for those models that do not reach 6,000 features. However, the requirements to process the model in the worst case scenario, that is, using a model containing 10,000 features, are 300 sec. and 3.84 GB of RAM memory, which are acceptable.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:boxplot_0_5} and figure~\ref{fig:plot:probs:boxplot_0_5_mem} show the results for processing the models generated using \textit{Config\_3}. In this case, half of the features in the model have a parallel relation. Similarly to the previous experiment, these charts show that both the execution time and the memory usage for processing a model when the number of features increases are exponential. In the obtained results we can observe the same turning point detected in the previous models generated using \textit{Config\_2}, that is, when the model reaches 6,000 features. Model processing requirements, that is, execution time and memory usage, grow much faster for these models than for those based on previous configurations. Also, it is important to notice that the models containing 9,000 and 10,000 features cannot be processed due to memory limitations.

Broadly speaking, these results show that increasing the number of features having a parallel relation has a direct impact on the overall performance. In fact, increasing the number of features having a parallel relation generates a combinatorial explosion that hampers the processing of models. First, the execution time to completely process a model significantly grows. Second, large amounts of memory are required to store those combinations. In some cases, using large models with a high percentage of features having a parallel relation may cause a bottleneck in the memory system. In fact, models generated using \textit{Config\_3} with 9,000 and 10,000 features cannot be processed using 64 GB of RAM.

\subsection{Comparison between results and related work}
\label{sec:stat:impl:comp}

We now compare the last results with the ones obtained using \fodaPA~\cite{acl13}
and the cost extension \fodaPAc~\cite{clc16}.

Specifically we want to compare the implementation performance
between the probabilistic extension and the denotation denotational semantic module
from \fodaPA~\cite{acl13}.

Figure~\ref{figure:tool:den:benchmark} shows that
the experiments ran with a number of different
features ranging from $50$ to $300$.

In this paper we managed to calculate models up to 
13000 features without timeouts.

Also based on the results published in \fodaPAc~\cite{clc16}
the models used for the simulations were processed in 
an 8-node cluster but the model had only
17 features.

Figure~\ref{fig:cluster} shows the algorithm behavior 
which best time its approximately 300 seconds.

For those specific implementations and
simulations we can highlight
that the denotational semantics of the probabilistic
extension implementation improves dramatically
the performance
in comparison with the denotational semantics implementations
presented in previous works.

%We have two open issues:
%\begin{description}
%\item[Unit testing]  Let $P$ be a software product line, and $T_{unit}$ be a
%  test suite. Each test checks the correctness of a feature (i.e, %\feature{A} or \feature{B}).
%  We can compute the \emph{probability} of a feature. We test before those features with bigger probability.
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item We can calculate the most frequent set of features in $P$ to test.
  %\item  We can provide a coverage of the test suite taking into account the percentage of appearance of each feature.
  %\end{itemize}

%\item[Integration testing] We have a test suite $T_{integration}$ where each test checks
%  the integration of a product.
%  Let us note that the integration of the product $\{\feature{A},\feature{B}\}$  can be different than
%  the integration of $\{\feature{A}, \feature{B},\feature{C}\}$.
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Which tests of the suite can be applied in this SPL?
 % \item What is the coverage of each test suite?
 % \end{itemize}


%\end{description}


%Next step is to associate to each integration test the time that
%it needs to be completed.
%For instance in Figure~\ref{fig:input:parameter} we represent some integration tests and the
%time that they need to be completed.



%\begin{quote}
%\emph{Let us consider an integration test suite and a probabilistic SPL $P$.
%If we only have $n$ time units, which is the \emph{best set} of tests
%to check the correctness of $P$? We say that a test is better than another
%test if its representativity (the probability to perform these features together) is higher.}
%\end{quote}

%\bprop
%        The previous problem is NP-hard\ccomen{I propose the transformation into the Subset Sum problem.}.
%\eprop

%Next we define the subset sum problem.

%\bdfn
%    Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ be a  set of natural numbers and $s$ be  a positive integer.
%    The subset sum problem checks if there is a subset $A'\subseteq A$ such that:  $$\sum_{a\in A'} = s$$
%\edfn

%In our previous problem we have a set of pairs $B=\{(p_{1},t_{1}),(p_{2},t_{2}),\ldots,(p_{n},t_{n})\}$ where
%$p_{i}$ is the probability to perform the test $i$ and $t_{i}$ is the time needed to perform this test, and
%two constants $P$ and $T$. $P$ will represent a probability value and $T$ a time value.
%We are looking for those pairs $(p_{i},t_{i}),\ldots,(p_{j},t_{j})\in B$ that
%$$
%\begin{array}{ll}
%p_{i}+\ldots +p_{j} &\geq P\\
%t_{i}+\ldots +t_{j} &\leq T\\
%\end{array}
%$$

%Let us consider that $p_{i}=t_{i}={a_i}$ and $P=T=s$.
%We can rewrite the previous problem into

%$$
%\left.
%\begin{array}{ll}
%a_{i}+\ldots +a_{j} &\geq s\\
%a_{i}+\ldots +a_{j} &\leq s\\
%\end{array}
%\right\}=
%a_{i}+\ldots +a_{j} = s\
%$$

%And we have the subset sum problem\ccomen{Please check because $p_{i}$ and $t_{i}$ can be reals while $s_{i}$ are integers}.


%\begin{enumerate}
%        \item We can create a GA to solve this problem.
%        \item We have that this problem is FPTAS~\cite{Ibarra:1975:FAA:321906.321909}.
%\end{enumerate}



%In order to obtain a set of tests that holds the previous issues, we propose
%two implementations.
%The first one is using a dynamic algorithm while the second one to use a genetic algorithm.

%\subsection{Dynamic algorithm}

% We adapted the dynamic algorithm of 0-1 Knapsack problem
%to our problem and we implemented it in python.


%We define a matrix $A$, where $A(i,j)$ contains the
%maximum value that can be attained from considering
%only the sum of the first i tests' probability that need at most j time units.


%$$
%A(i,j)=
%\left\{
%        \begin{array}{lll}
%        0 &\hspace*{3em}&\si i=0 \lor j = 0\\
%        A(i-1,j) & & \si t_i>j\\
%        \max{(A(i-1,j),p_{i}+A(i-1,j-t_i))} &&\si t_i \leq j
%        \end{array}
%\right.
%$$

%In our case, we will say that $A(n,T)$ is the solution if the sum of the  percentages
%of all elements involved in this solution is bigger than or equal to $P$. Otherwise we do not have a solution.


%For instance, in Table~\ref{figure:input:parameters} there are presented a set of 24
%different tests with their time consuming and its probability.
%For instance the first element, t1,9,150, means the test t1 needs 9 time units to be completed
%and the value associated with this test is 150\footnote{We could put here a measure, the probability or anything}.

% we obtain that {\tt \#1, \#2, \#3, \#4, \#5,

% \#18, \#19} and {\tt \#21}       conforms the final solution, and P =  1130.


% \subsection{Genetic Algorithm}

% Next we perform a genetic algorithm to discover a better solution.
% The GA structure is in Figure~\ref{scheme:genetic:algorithm}.
% With this algorithm we obtain values bigger than 1130.






% \subsubsection{Representation}
% We represent the possible solutions (those tests that hold the conditions) as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%         \item Genotype: Given $n$ tests, we represent a solution with a binary (1/0) string
% of length $n$ where the position i determines whether the ith-test is included or not.
% The genotype space is complete, that is, any valid solution can be mapped in this array.
%         \item Phenotype: There are only some genotypes that are \emph{correct}. These are
% those that taking the $n'$, with $n'\leq n$ first $1$ bits from left to right of a genotype, we have that the sum of
% the time values associated with these tests is lower than or equal to T,
% and that the representativity of these tests is $\geq P$.
% \end{itemize}


% \subsubsection{Initial Population}
% We execute the algorithm with the parameters presented in Figure~\ref{fig:parameters:initial:population} in order to show
% how many initial population do we need.
% There is an interesting effect that this experiment reveals.
% The first and second graphs indicate that for populations smaller than 50 the chance for premature convergence seems to be rather high.
% Therefore we will consider that a good candidate for initial population is 500.

% We will use 0.8 in the rest of experiments because a) we obtain the maximum fitness, and b) the difference between maximum and minimum is low.

% Let us also note that adding more values of recombination probability (i.e, 100\%), that is also presented in
%  Figure~\ref{fig:parameters:recombination} does not imply to have better fitness solutions. So, this value should be high
% but not 100\%.

% \subsubsection{Mutation operator}

% We define two mutation operators in the chromosomes. The first one: swap means to change
% the element i with the element j. The second one: Integer range, means that we change a bit
% randomly.

% In our algorithm we are able to use both mutators operators.
% In Figure~\ref{fig:parameters:mutation:operator} the effects of executing swap, integer range or both
% are presented.

% We can observe that only swap let the fitness score to be regular with respect to the number of generations.
% When we change randomly a bit in the chromosomes then the fitness score cannot be predictable.

% \subsubsection{Parent Selection}

% Finally we compare the parent selection methodology used in our algorithm.
% We implement three kind of selections: Rank, Roulette and Tournament.
% In our experiments we decided to use Roulette because it is always increasing,
% and it seems that we can continue improving the valuation of the set of tests over time.
% Moreover the others seem to be saturated.
