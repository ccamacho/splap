\section{$\fodaPAp$: syntax and semantics}
\label{sec:stat:sintaxMain}
In this section we introduce our language. In addition to present its syntax, we define an operational semantics and a denotational semantics. In the next section we will show the equivalence between these two semantic frameworks.


\subsection{Syntax and operational semantics}
\label{sec:stat:sintax}
Following our previous work~\cite{acl13,clc16}, we will consider a
set of features. We denote this set by $\calF$ and consider that $\feature{A}, \feature{B},
\feature{C}$ range over $\calF$. We have a special feature
$\checkmark\not\in\calF$ to mark the end  of a product. We consider a syntax similar to
\fodaPA, where probabilities are introduced in the choice operator $P \choice_{p} Q $ and in
the optional feature operator $\ofeature{A};_{p} P$. We do not allow
\emph{degenerated} probabilities, that is, for all probability $p$ we have $0< p<1$.

The operators syntax is defined as in~\cite{acl13,clc16}.
In order to define the syntax, 
we need to fix the set of \emph{features}. 
From now on $\calF$ denotes a finite set  of features
and  \feature{A}, \feature{B}, \feature{C}\dots\ denote isolated features.

In the syntax of the language there are two sets of operators. 
On the one hand there are \emph{main operators}, such as $\cdot\choice\cdot$, $\cdot\paral\cdot$, $\feature{A};\cdot$, $\ofeature{A};\cdot$, 
$\require{A}{B}{\cdot}$, $\exclude{A}{B}{\cdot}$,
that directly correspond to relationships in \FODA\ Diagrams.
On the other hand, we have \emph{auxiliary operators}, such as $\nil$, $\checkmark$, $\forbid{A}{\cdot}$, $\mandatory{A}{\cdot}$,
which we need to define the semantics of the language.


\bdfn
\label{sec:stat:sintax:dfn}
A \emph{probabilitistc SPL} is a term generated by the following
BNF expression:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
P::=& \checkmark \barra \nil \barra \feature{A};P \barra
\ofeature{A};_{p} P \barra P \choice_{p} P \barra P \paral P \barra
\\
& \exclude{A}{B}{P}\barra  \require{A}{B}{P}\barra  \forbid{A}{P}\barra  \mandatory{A}{P}\\
\end{array}
$$
\noindent
where $\feature{A},\feature{B} \in \calF$ and $p\in(0,1)$. The set of terms of the
algebra will be denoted by  $\fodaPAp$.
\edfn



In order to avoid writing too many parentheses in the terms, we are
going to assume left-associativity in binary operators and  the
following precedence in the operators (from higher to lower priority):
$\feature{A};P$, $\ofeature{A};_{p} P$, $ P \choice_{p} Q$, $P\paral Q$,
$\exclude{A}{B}{P}$, $\require{A}{B}{P}$, 
$\require{A}{B}{P}$,  $\forbid{A}{P}$, and $\mandatory{A}{P}$.
In~\cite{acl13,clc16} we demonstrated that
the binary
operators are commutative and associative.
As a result, the
\emph{choose-one} operator ($\cdot\choice_{p}\cdot$) and the
\emph{conjunction} operator ($\cdot\paral\cdot$) are $n$-ary operators
instead of just binary operators. 


The Extended BNF in Definition~\ref{sec:stat:sintax:dfn} says
that a term of \fodaPA\ is
a sequence of operators and features.

There are two terminal symbols in
the language, $\nil$ and $\checkmark$,
we need them to define the semantics of the language.
%, see 
%The first semantics where we will use them will be an \emph{operational} semantics.
Let us note that the products of a term in \fodaPA\ will be computed following some rules.
The computation will finish when no further steps are allowed. 
This fact is represented by the $\nil$ symbol. 
We will introduce rules to compute a product, with this computation
finishing when no further steps are required, a situation represented by~\nil.
During the computation of an \fodaPAp\ term,  we have 
to represent the situation in which a \emph{valid product} 
of the term has been computed. 
This fact is represented by the $\checkmark$ symbol.

The operators $\feature{A};P$ and $\ofeature{A}_{p};P$ add the feature $\feature{A}$ to any product that can be obtained
from $P$. The operator $\feature{A};P$ indicates that $\feature{A}$ is mandatory while $\ofeature{A}_{p};P$ indicates
that $\feature{A}$ is optional and computed with probability $_{p}$.
There are two binary operators: $P \choice_{p} Q$ and $P\paral Q$. The
first one represents the \emph{choose-one} operator while the second one represents the  \emph{conjunction} operator.

The constraints are easily represented in \fodaPAp.
The operator $\require{A}{B}{P}$ represents the \emph{require}
constraint in \FODA.
The operator $\exclude{A}{B}{P}$ represents the \emph{exclusion}
constraint in \FODA.  

The operator $\mandatory{A}{P}$ is necessary to define the behavior
of the $\require{A}{B}{P}$ operator:
When we compute the products of the term $\require{A}{B}{P}$, we have 
to take into account whether  product  \feature{A} has been produced or not.
In the case it has been produced, we have to annotate 
that we need to produce \feature{B} in the future.
The operator $\mandatory{B}{P}$  is used for this purpose.
The same happens with  the operator $\forbid{B}{P}$.
% is necessary to define the semantics of the $\exclude{A}{B}{P}$.
When we  compute the products of $\exclude{A}{B}{P}$,   
if the feature \feature{A} is computed
at some point, we  annotate
that \feature{B} must not be included. The operator $\forbid{B}{P}$ indicates
that product \feature{B} is forbidden.
