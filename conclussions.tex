\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:jstat:concs}

Once described all the problems related to the combinatory explosion
for some of the algebra's operators, we aim to generate enough information
allowing to determine the probability of a probability in the valid
products set.
%
To do so we have defined new syntactical operators for the probabilistic
extension. Once defined, we have represented the extension to give a logical
meaning to these semantic rules based on the operational semantics
and denotational semantics.
%
Also this extension was proven to be consistent against the presented definitions
and with the non probabilistic models.
%
The implementation of this extension allows to compute and calculate the probability of the features among the valid products.
